# Machine Learning Iris Dataset
Iris data set; It is a data set that includes 150 samples in total, 50 of which are from one species, belonging to 3 Iris plant species (Iris versicolor, Iris virginica and Iris setosa), in which information about petal length and scope, sepal length and width are given. With this project, our aim is to predict which species the leafy plant belongs to. As can be understood, this is a classification problem.

#Let's develop our project by following the steps below
1.Importing the necessary libraries
2.Uploading and preparing the data set
3.Examining the data set
4.Visualization of the data set
5.Application of algorithms and evaluation of their results
6.Choosing the appropriate algorithm and making predictions
